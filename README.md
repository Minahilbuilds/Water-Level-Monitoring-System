# Water-Level-Monitoring-System
This project is a real-time water level and environmental monitoring system built on the STM32F407VGT6 microcontroller. It uses an ultrasonic sensor to measure water levels, a DHT22 sensor for temperature and humidity, and displays data on a 16Ã—2 LCD while transmitting it via an HC-05 Bluetooth module. A potentiometer sets the water level threshold, with buzzers and LEDs providing alerts and visual indicators when predefined limits are exceeded. The system combines real-time monitoring, control, and wireless communication in a compact embedded solution.
