# Water-Level-Monitoring-System
This project is a real-time water level and environmental monitoring system built on the STM32F407VGT6 microcontroller. It uses an ultrasonic sensor to measure water levels and a DHT22 sensor for temperature and humidity, displaying all readings on a 16Ã—2 LCD. A potentiometer sets the water level threshold, with buzzers and LEDs providing alerts when limits are crossed. All real-time sensor readings, including water level, temperature, and humidity, are also transmitted via an HC-05 Bluetooth module to a mobile device for remote monitoring. The system offers reliable multi-sensor data tracking, control, and wireless communication in a compact embedded setup.
