# Water-Level-Monitoring-System
This repository contains the code for a real-time water level and environmental monitoring system using the STM32F407VGT6 microcontroller. It measures water level, temperature, and humidity via an ultrasonic sensor and DHT22, displaying data on a 16Ã—2 LCD. A potentiometer sets the water level threshold, with buzzers and LEDs providing alerts when limits are exceeded. All readings are also transmitted to a mobile device through an HC-05 Bluetooth module for remote monitoring.
